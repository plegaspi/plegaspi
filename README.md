### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- Hi, Iâ€™m Paul.
- Iâ€™m interested in chip design.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to write LaTeX.
- I'm originally from Hawaii.
- I'm a sophomore in electrical engineering.
- I chose my major because it gives me the tools to examine technology from a hardware and software perspective.
- A fun fact about me is: I read the last book of the Harry Potter series first.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? I want to learn how to write better code.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Bad Times at the El Royale.
